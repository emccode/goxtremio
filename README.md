# GoXtremIO

## Overview
```GoXtremIO``` represents API bindings for Go that allow you to manage XtremIO storage platforms.  In the true nature of API bindings, it is intended that the functions available are basically a direct implementation of what is available through the API.

## API Compatibility
Currently only tested with XMS v3.

## Functions
Name | Description
---- | -----------
`GetEvents` | get a list or filtered list of events
`GetInitiator` | get a specific initiator by name or ID
`GetInitiators` | get a non-detailed list of initiators
`GetInitiatorGroup` | get a specific initiator group by name or ID
`GetInitiatorGroups` | get a non-detailed list of initiator groups
`GetIGFolder` | get a specific initiator group folder by name or ID
`GetIGFolders` | get a non-detailed list of initiator folders
`GetISCSIPortal` | get a specific ISCSI portal by name or ID
`GetISCSIPortals` | get a non-detailed list of ISCSI portals
`GetLunMap` | get a specific LUN map by name or ID
`GetLunMaps` | get a non-detailed list of LUN maps
`NewLunMap` | create a new LUN map
`DeleteLunMap` | delete a LUN map
`GetSnapshot` | get a specific snapshot by name or ID
`GetSnapshots` | get a non-detailed list of snapshots
`NewSnapshot` | create a new snapshot of a volume
`DeleteSnapshot` | delete a snapshot
`GetVolume` | get a specific volume by name or ID
`GetVolumes` | get a non-detailed list of volumes
`NewVolume` | create a new volume
`DeleteVolume` | delete a volume
`GetVolumeFolder` | get a specific volume folder by name or ID
`GetVolumeFolders` | get a non-detailed list of volume folders

## Examples
The package was written using test files so, these can be looked at for a more comprehensive view of how to implement the different functions.

Intialize a new client

	c, err := NewClient() // or NewClientWithArgs(endpoint, insecure, userName, password)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

Get an Initiator Group by Name

    initiator, err := c.GetInitiatorGroup("", "VPLEX-ee20")
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }

Create a Volume

    opts := &NewVolumeOptions{
      VolName: "testing1",
      VolSize: 1073741824,
    }
    
    result, err := c.NewVolume(opts)
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }

Map a Volume

    opts := &NewLunMapOptions{
      VolID: 24,
      IgID:  4,
    }
    
    result, err := c.NewLunMap(opts)
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
    
For example usage you can see the [Rex-RAY](https://github.com/emccode/rexray) repo.  There, the ```goxtremio``` package is used to implement a ```Volume Manager``` across multiple storage platforms. This includes managing multipathing, mounts, and filesystems.

## Environment Variables
Name | Description
---- | -----------
`GOXTREMIO_ENDPOINT` | the API endpoint, ie. https://10.5.132.140/api/json
`GOXTREMIO_USERNAME` | the username
`GOXTREMIO_PASSWORD` | the password
`GOXTREMIO_INSECURE` | whether to skip SSL validation
`GOXTREMIO_DEBUG` | enables debug logging

## Contributions
Please contribute! The API bindings are not 100% complete based on the v3 API, so there is some work left to implement all features.
